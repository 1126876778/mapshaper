**mapshaper** is a tool for simplifying polygon datasets.

- Simplification methods include: Douglas Peucker, Visvalingam and a modified version of Visvalingam's algorithm designed to smooth spiky features.
- Reads Shapefiles and writes Shapefile and GeoJSON files. Support is planned for reading and writing TopoJSON and KML.
- Run `$ mapshaper --help` for options and examples.
- mapshaper currently runs in node as a commandline tool. A graphical browser interface is in the works.
