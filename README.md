###mapshaper is a tool for simplifying polygon datasets.

- Simplification methods include: Douglas Peucker, Visvalingam and a modified version of Visvalingam's algorithm designed to smooth spiky features.
- Reads Shapefiles and writes Shapefile and GeoJSON files.
- **mapshaper** runs in node as a commandline tool (bin/mapshaper). `$ mapshaper -h` displays a help message.
- Run `$ build` in the project directory to rebuild the mapshaper library from source files.
- See TODO.md for a list of planned features.
